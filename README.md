## Notes

This API client is fully working though not necessarily completed. Of course, any updates that aren't backwards-compatible will be bumped up a major version. Other than that, here's some info you'll probably want to know.

- This client does **not** disable SSL. It ships with a Certificate Authority bundle and uses this bundle to verify the Envato API's SSL certificate, instead of relying on the system's often-unavailable certificate.

## Installation

Include this into your project using Composer. It will be autoloaded.

```
composer require baileyherbert/envato
```

## Authentication

### Personal Token

Start a new client with a personal token (create one at build.envato.com).

```php
$token = new Herbert\Envato\Auth\Token('Your Personal Token');
$client = new Herbert\EnvatoClient($token);
```

### OAuth

This is a bit more complicated. Using OAuth means you'll need to redirect your users. In general, the below code will work fine. If you wish to store the OAuth session (for example, in a database or cookie) to be able to load it later, see [Persistent OAuth](#persistent-oauth).

```php
// Generate the OAuth object
$oauth = new Herbert\Envato\Auth\OAuth([
    'client_id' => 'Your client id',
    'client_secret' => 'Your client secret',
    'redirect_uri' => 'https://your-redirect-uri.com/'
]);

// Get the token (returns null if unavailable)
$token = $oauth->auth;

// Redirect the user if they're not authorized yet
if (!$token) {
    header("Location: " . $oauth->getAuthorizationUri());
    die;
}

// Create the client
$client = new Herbert\EnvatoClient($token);
```

- The `OAuth` object contains methods to generate an authorization URI.
- To make this example work, the `redirect_uri` should point back to the current file.
- Calling `$oauth->token` will automatically recognize the `code` sent back by Envato and will return something truthy that you can pass into `EnvatoClient()`.

### Persistent OAuth

In the example above, we authenticated using OAuth. This redirected the user to the Envato API for authorization, and generated a new set of access and refresh tokens.

However, in many cases, we will want to _save_ this information for future use. Fortunately, this is easy to do.

```php
$oauth = new Herbert\Envato\Auth\OAuth([
    'client_id' => 'Your client id',
    'client_secret' => 'Your client secret',
    'redirect_uri' => 'https://your-redirect-uri.com/'
]);

// Load an OAuth session
if (isset($_SESSION['oauth_session'])) {
    $oauth->load($_SESSION['oauth_session']);
}

// No saved session, so let's start a new one
else {
    if ($oauth->auth) {
        // Save the OAuth session
        $_SESSION['oauth_session'] = $oauth->session;
    }
    else {
        // User is not logged in, so redirect them
        header("Location: " . $oauth->getAuthorizationUri());
        die;
    }
}

// Create the client
$client = new Herbert\EnvatoClient($oauth->auth);
```

- The `$oauth->session` member will contain a JSON string with data for the current authorization.
- The `$oauth->load()` method accepts that JSON string and uses it to load the authorization.
- You can create a new `EnvatoClient` after this, like normal.
- When the access token provided by Envato expires, the client will be able to automatically create a new access token using the saved session data.

## Sending Requests

Here's an example request to get the current user's username. Currently, it returns a `ResultSet` object; this object exposes a `results` property which is an array of the raw API response.

```php
$response = $client->user->username();

if (!$response->error) {
    $username = $response->results['username'];

    echo "Logged in as {$username}";
}
else {
    echo "Error: {$response->error}";
}
```

For an endpoint which has variables, you can pass them as an array. This works for all endpoint versions, including legacy v1 and the new v3.

```php
$response = $client->profile->portfolio([
    'username' => 'baileyherbert'
]);
```


### Getting Request Time

To determine how long a request took to execute (in seconds), you can reference the `$response->time` property.


### Rate Limiting

If you're being rate limited, the client will throw a `TooManyRequestsException` exception. The exception instance has
methods to help work with the rate limit.

```php
use Herbert\Envato\Exceptions\TooManyRequestsException;

try {
    $item = $client->catalog->item(['id' => 1234567]);
}
catch (TooManyRequestsException $e) {
    // Get the number of seconds remaining (float)
    $secondsRemaining = $e->getSecondsRemaining();

    // Get the timestamp for when we can make our next request
    $timestamp = $e->getRetryTime();

    // Sleep until the rate limiting has ended
    $e->wait();
}
```

## Handling Errors & Exceptions

All exceptions in this libary are under the `Herbert\Envato\Exceptions` namespace.

### Authorization Errors

When performing OAuth authorization, you may encounter one of these exceptions:

- `InvalidTokenException` if the token provided is not a string.
- `MissingPropertyException` if OAuth is missing one of the constructor parameters (client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri).
- `NotAuthenticatedException` if you try to construct an `EnvatoClient` before being authenticated.

### Request Errors

When performing a request, there are four possible exceptions that can be thrown.

- `BadRequestException` if required arguments are missing or are invalid.
- `UnauthorizedException` if the current authorization is invalid.
- `TooManyRequestsException` if requests are being throttled for high activity.
- `EndpointException` if there was a major error (API down, no internet connection, etc).

Otherwise, if an error occurs in the request, it will be accessible in detail using the `$response->error` property (which is `null` when successful or a `string` with error details otherwise).

## Examples

### Verifying Purchase Codes

If you're an author and want to check a purchase code provided to you from a buyer, this is an example for you. To make this work, you'll want to use [Personal Token](#personal-token) authentication.

```php
$purchase_code = 'purchase code here';
$token = new Herbert\Envato\Auth\Token('Your Personal Token');
$client = new Herbert\EnvatoClient($token);

$response = $client->user->sale(['code' => $purchase_code]);

if (!$response->error) {
    $sale = $response->results;

    $sold_at = $sale['sold_at']; // "2013-04-16T01:59:35+10:00"
    $license = $sale['license']; // "Regular License"
    $supported_until = $sale['supported_until']; // "2013-10-16T00:00:00+10:00"

    $item_id = $sale['item']['id']; // 1252984
    $item_name = $sale['item']['name']; // "Item Name"
    $author_username = $sale['item']['author_username']; // "baileyherbert"

    $num_licenses = $sale['purchase_count']; // 3
    $buyer_username = $sale['buyer']; // "bestbuyerever"

    echo "I got information!";
}
else {
    echo "The code produced an error:\n";
    echo $response->error;
}
```
